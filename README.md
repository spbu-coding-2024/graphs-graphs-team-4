## ðŸ”§ Main functionality

- 
- Graph analysis:
  - Algorithm for graph layout on the plane
  - Search for communities using the Louvain algorithm
  - Classical algorithms:
      - Extraction of strongly connected components
      - Search for cycles from a given vertex
      - Construction of a minimum spanning tree (MST)
      - Search for the shortest path - Ford Bellman
- Saving and loading graphs:
  - Storing graphs in SQLite
  - Integration with Neo4j

## ðŸ–¼ Interface

The application uses the **MVVM** architectural pattern. Graphs are displayed in a convenient interactive form with visualization of the algorithms' results.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Unit tests for algorithms 
- Integration tests with user scenarios (SQLite saving and loading + Ford Bellman and Find Cycles)

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies

- Language: Kotlin 
- GUI: Jetpack Compose 
- DataBases: SQLite, Neo4j
- Testing: `JUnit5`

## ðŸš€ Installation and launch

// TODO
